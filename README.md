## Instant Gratification:

We will start the course by installing Ollama so you can see results immediately!
1. Download and install Ollama from https://ollama.com noting that on a PC you might need to have administrator permissions for the install to work properly
2. On a PC, start a Command prompt / Powershell (Press Win + R, type `cmd`, and press Enter). On a Mac, start a Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
3. Run `ollama run llama3.2` or for smaller machines try `ollama run llama3.2:1b`
4. If this doesn't work, you may need to run `ollama serve` in another Powershell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), and try step 3 again
